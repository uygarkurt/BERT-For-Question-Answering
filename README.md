![Sample Result](./assets/qa-sample.png)

This repository contains an easy-to-use and understand code to fine-tune BERT for Question-Answering(Q&A) task. Sample training was made by using [SQuAD Dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). Dataset preparation part was inspired from [HuggingFace Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.2.0/custom_datasets.html#question-answering-with-squad-2-0).

Above example demonstrates a sample context, question and answer.
